% Step 1: USRP creates signal
usrp = USRP();
usrpSignal = usrp.GenerateSignal();

%VCO creates signal
%Amplifier amplifies signal of VCO
%Amplified signal goes to 2 way splitter
%2 way splitter creates two signals
%Signal A and Signal B

%USRP Signal passes to Mixer
%Signal A from splitter also passes to mixer
mixer = Mixer();

%Create target
%Receive signal from target

%Received signal goes through low Noise Amplifier
%New signal goes into mixer
%Signal B from splitter goes into mixer

%Send final signal to Plot Results Class
